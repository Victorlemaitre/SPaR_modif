Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost. Two geologists were researching agents of landscape change.

If there are any constraints in the Prompt that are not satisfied by the Output, please list all the constraints that are not satisfied.\n\nPrompt: “Glaciers, while geographically restricted, are effective agents of landscape change. The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin. The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost. Two geologists were researching agents of landscape change. Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated. They later compared and exchanged data. Which researcher studied more about the debris transported by the glacier?

The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin. The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost. Two geologists were researching agents of landscape change.

In the instruction-following task, the Output needs to honestly/precisely/closely follow the given Prompt.\nYour task is to carefully judge whether the Output to honestly/precisely/closely follows the given Prompt. If there are any constraints in the Prompt that are not satisfied by the Output, please list all the constraints that are not satisfied.\n\nPrompt: “Glaciers, while geographically restricted, are effective agents of landscape change. The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin. The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost. Two geologists were researching agents of landscape change. Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated. They later compared and exchanged data. Which researcher studied more about the debris transported by the glacier? Please provide your response in no more than three sentences, using a formal tone and ensuring that glacial terminology is accurately applied. Additionally, include a comparison of the significance of glacial and nonglacial processes in landscape evolution. Limit your answer to a maximum of 150 words. ”\n\nOutput: “Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated.

If there are any constraints in the Prompt that are not satisfied by the Output, please list all the constraints that are not satisfied.\n\nPrompt: “Glaciers, while geographically restricted, are effective agents of landscape change. The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin. The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost. Two geologists were researching agents of landscape change. Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated. They later compared and exchanged data. Which researcher studied more about the debris transported by the glacier? Please provide your response in no more than three sentences, using a formal tone and ensuring that glacial terminology is accurately applied. Additionally, include a comparison of the significance of glacial and nonglacial processes in landscape evolution. Limit your answer to a maximum of 150 words. ”\n\nOutput: “Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated.

In the instruction-following task, the Output needs to honestly/precisely/closely follow the given Prompt.\nYour task is to carefully judge whether the Output to honestly/precisely/closely follows the given Prompt. If there are any constraints in the Prompt that are not satisfied by the Output, please list all the constraints that are not satisfied.\n\nPrompt: “Glaciers, while geographically restricted, are effective agents of landscape change. The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin. The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost. Two geologists were researching agents of landscape change. Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated. They later compared and exchanged data. Which researcher studied more about the debris transported by the glacier? Please provide your response in no more than three sentences, using a formal tone and ensuring that glacial terminology is accurately applied. Additionally, include a comparison of the significance of glacial and nonglacial processes in landscape evolution. Limit your answer to a maximum of 150 words. ”\n\nOutput: “Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated.

In the instruction-following task, the Output needs to honestly/precisely/closely follow the given Prompt.\nYour task is to carefully judge whether the Output to honestly/precisely/closely follows the given Prompt. If there are any constraints in the Prompt that are not satisfied by the Output, please list all the constraints that are not satisfied.\n\nPrompt: “Glaciers, while geographically restricted, are effective agents of landscape change. The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin. The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost. Two geologists were researching agents of landscape change. Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated. They later compared and exchanged data. Which researcher studied more about the debris transported by the glacier? Please provide your response in no more than three sentences, using a formal tone and ensuring that glacial terminology is accurately applied. Additionally, include a comparison of the significance of glacial and nonglacial processes in landscape evolution. Limit your answer to a maximum of 150 words. ”\n\nOutput: “Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated.

If there are any constraints in the Prompt that are not satisfied by the Output, please list all the constraints that are not satisfied.\n\nPrompt: “Glaciers, while geographically restricted, are effective agents of landscape change. The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin. The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost. Two geologists were researching agents of landscape change. Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated. They later compared and exchanged data. Which researcher studied more about the debris transported by the glacier? Please provide your response in no more than three sentences, using a formal tone and ensuring that glacial terminology is accurately applied. Additionally, include a comparison of the significance of glacial and nonglacial processes in landscape evolution. Limit your answer to a maximum of 150 words. ”\n\nOutput: “Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated.

If there are any constraints in the Prompt that are not satisfied by the Output, please list all the constraints that are not satisfied.\n\nPrompt: “Glaciers, while geographically restricted, are effective agents of landscape change. The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin. The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost. Two geologists were researching agents of landscape change. Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated. They later compared and exchanged data. Which researcher studied more about the debris transported by the glacier? Please provide your response in no more than three sentences, using a formal tone and ensuring that glacial terminology is accurately applied. Additionally, include a comparison of the significance of glacial and nonglacial processes in landscape evolution. Limit your answer to a maximum of 150 words. ”\n\nOutput: “Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated.

If there are any constraints in the Prompt that are not satisfied by the Output, please list all the constraints that are not satisfied.\n\nPrompt: “Glaciers, while geographically restricted, are effective agents of landscape change. The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin. The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost. Two geologists were researching agents of landscape change. Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated. They later compared and exchanged data. Which researcher studied more about the debris transported by the glacier? Please provide your response in no more than three sentences, using a formal tone and ensuring that glacial terminology is accurately applied. Additionally, include a comparison of the significance of glacial and nonglacial processes in landscape evolution. Limit your answer to a maximum of 150 words. ”\n\nOutput: “Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated.

In the instruction-following task, the Output needs to honestly/precisely/closely follow the given Prompt.\nYour task is to carefully judge whether the Output to honestly/precisely/closely follows the given Prompt. If there are any constraints in the Prompt that are not satisfied by the Output, please list all the constraints that are not satisfied.\n\nPrompt: “Glaciers, while geographically restricted, are effective agents of landscape change. The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin. The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost. Two geologists were researching agents of landscape change. Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated. They later compared and exchanged data. Which researcher studied more about the debris transported by the glacier? Please provide your response in no more than three sentences, using a formal tone and ensuring that glacial terminology is accurately applied. Additionally, include a comparison of the significance of glacial and nonglacial processes in landscape evolution. Limit your answer to a maximum of 150 words. ”\n\nOutput: “Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated.

In the instruction-following task, the Output needs to honestly/precisely/closely follow the given Prompt.\nYour task is to carefully judge whether the Output to honestly/precisely/closely follows the given Prompt. If there are any constraints in the Prompt that are not satisfied by the Output, please list all the constraints that are not satisfied.\n\nPrompt: “Glaciers, while geographically restricted, are effective agents of landscape change. The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin. The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost. Two geologists were researching agents of landscape change. Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated. They later compared and exchanged data. Which researcher studied more about the debris transported by the glacier? Please provide your response in no more than three sentences, using a formal tone and ensuring that glacial terminology is accurately applied. Additionally, include a comparison of the significance of glacial and nonglacial processes in landscape evolution. Limit your answer to a maximum of 150 words. ”\n\nOutput: “Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated.

If there are any constraints in the Prompt that are not satisfied by the Output, please list all the constraints that are not satisfied.\n\nPrompt: “Glaciers, while geographically restricted, are effective agents of landscape change. The gradual movement of ice down a valley causes abrasion and plucking of the underlying rock. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed glacial flour. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a moraine. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin. The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of Plio-Pleistocene landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed paraglacial processes. This concept contrasts with periglacial processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost. Two geologists were researching agents of landscape change. Danny studied glaciated environments, while Manny researched those that have never been glaciated. They later compared and exchanged data. Which researcher studied more about the debris transported by the glacier?
