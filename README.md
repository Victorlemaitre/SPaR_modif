SPaR focuses on creating interference-free preference pairs for effective self- improvement. An example of the interfering factors (*story content*) in independently sampled multiple responses (Left). Refined response pairs exclude these factors, highlight the key difference (*ending sentence*), and lead to improved performance on iteratively trained LLaMA3-8B-Instruct (Right).

## Data

### SPaR dataset
SPaR Dataset can be found on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/CCCCCC/SPaR).

We provide a high-quality SFT dataset for instruction-following tasks and the data for iterative self-training.


## Quick Start
For all codes, we have added `#TODO` comments to indicate places in the code that need modification before running. Please update the relevant parts as noted before executing each file.

### Data Construction
To construct the iterative training data yourself, run the following command
```bash
cd src

bash infer.sh

python process_data.py

bash judge.py

python process_data.py

vllm serve <your-model-path>

python tree_search.py

python process_data.py
```

### Model Training
If you want to train your own model, 
please run the following command:
```bash
cd src

# dpo
llamafactory-cli train configs/dpo.yaml

# sft
llamafactory-cli train configs/sft.yaml

```
