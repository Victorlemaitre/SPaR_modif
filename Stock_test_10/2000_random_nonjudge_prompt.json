You do not have to be spineless in order to be popular. In fact, you will be liked or loved if you are not afraid to stand up for your rights. But do it politely and pleasantly. Being friendly and polite to your group, to other people and to strangers, especially to those who do not look important or do not interest you, is one way to develop a good character. You cannot expect to be perfect, and you must learn not to be unhappy when you make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes, and no one is to be blamed if he does not refuse to learn from them. Many young people become discouraged when they know in themselves qualities that they do not like--selfishness, laziness, and other unpleasant qualities. Just remember that we all have some of these faults and have to fight against them. At the same time, it is important to remember that while you are probably no worse than others, the best way to be happy is to think yourself above other people. When something is wrong, it is good sense to try to make it right. Perhaps you do not like a teacher or a classmate. Try to see why, and look at yourself, too, to be sure that you are not doing anything to make that person dislike you.

The carpet can be viewed as a grid with height h and width w. Then the grid is divided into h × w squares. Alice is going to assign one of k different colors to each square. The colors are numbered from 1 to k. She may choose not to use all of the colors.\n\nHowever, there are some restrictions. For every two adjacent squares (squares that share an edge) x and y, there is a color constraint in one of the forms: \n\n  * color(x) = color(y), or \n  * color(x) ≠ color(y). \n\nIdeally, Alice wants to satisfy all color constraints. But again, life in the Arctic is hard. It is not always possible to satisfy all color constraints.

But the beginning of the end of that epidemic started Tuesday, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, told VOA. A bipartisan prison reform bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a 360-59 vote “strikes an opening blow against the overcriminalization of the nation,” Jeffries, one of the bill's co-sponsors, said. U.S. President Donald Trump said “the strong bipartisan vote paces the way for action by the Senate.” Last week, Trump endorsed the bill at a White House summit on prison reform, saying, “Our whole nation benefits if former inmates are able to reenter society as productive, law-abiding citizens.” If the bill reaches the president's desk for a signature, it would provide $50 million in funding for five years to provide job training, education and substance abuse treatment for prisoners as well as a number of quality-of-life measures aimed at reducing chronically high rates of recidivism among former inmates. But the contentious issue of criminal justice reform has split Democrats and Republicans within their own parties, possibly jeopardizing the bill’s chances of passage as it heads to the U.S. Senate. In a letter to colleagues last week, Democratic Senators Kamala Harris, Dick Durbin and Cory Booker joined two House Democratic colleagues, Representatives John Lewis and Sheila Jackson Lee, in saying the bill could not be implemented effectively and could possibly lead to prison privatization. Jeffries told VOA many of the arguments against the First Step Act “were anchored in falsehoods.” He added the legislation passed today “is a first step towards eradicating the cancer of mass incarceration” a move also welcomed by many House Republicans. “Rather than allowing the cycle of crime to continue, this legislation takes a practical, intelligent approach to rehabilitation,” House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican...

Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands. Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in kangaroo rats. They forage in relatively open habitats and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness. Nate and Andy were two zoologists.

	{"messages":[{"content":"Question: The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill Thursday that would protect from arbitrary dismissal the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\" The proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court. If a court determines the firing was not for \"good cause,\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea.

Mueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion and repeatedly denounced the probe as a \"witch hunt.\" Despite his harsh criticism of the Special Counsel and the Justice Department, Trump has dismissed reports that he's privately talked about firing Mueller.

It is an important industrial center because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez. Alexandria is also an important tourist destination.  - Egypt (; ', , \"Kimi\"), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, and across from the Sinai Peninsula lies Saudi Arabia, although Jordan and Saudi Arabia do not share a land border with Egypt. It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation.  - Alabarch is the Greek title of the customs official at the harbor of Alexandria during the Hellenistic and Roman periods.

The Nile, which is 6,853 km (4,258 miles) long, is an \"international\" river as its water resources are shared by eleven countries, namely, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo-Kinshasa, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt. In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt and Sudan.  - Ethnarch, pronounced , the anglicized form of ethnarches, refers generally to political leadership over a common ethnic group or homogeneous kingdom.

The colors are numbered from 1 to k. She may choose not to use all of the colors.\n\nHowever, there are some restrictions.

	{"messages":[{"content":"Context:\nAct - I\nThe play opens with worship to Lord Ganesha. Bhagwata comes to the stage. He is a character in the Play and also is the narrator of the play. He seeks blessings from Lord Ganesha for the successful performance of the play. Through his narration, he takes the audience to a place, called as Dharampur and introduces the audience to the king Dharmsheel. Then he puts up some rhetorical questions on incompleteness of man and God; and also on the perfection of a man. During his narration, he introduces two characters who are mutual friends. The first one is Devdutta. He is a sharp minded and highly intellectual person. He has defeated poets and Pandits with his knowledge. He is a son of Brahmin. The second one is Kapila. He is a muscular man. He has a great physical strength and he is a son of Lohar (Black Smith). Both Devdutta and Kapila are in contrast as the former lacks power and strength, the latter lacks knowledge and intellectual. According to the playwright, the head of Devdutta (knowledge) and the body of Kapila (physical strength) accomplish a complete man. The narrator compares their pair to the pair of Ram-Laxman, Luv-Kush and Krishna-Balram. All these are the pairs of great brothers in Hindu mythology.\n\nA character, Actor-1 appears on the stage shouting and running towards Bhagwata. He tells Bhagwata that he has just seen a strange creature that looks like a horse (by face) but speaks like a man. That creature has the head of a horse and the rest of the body of a man. Without paying any heed to his talks, Bhagwata asks him to get ready for the play. But he runs away from the stage and soon after he comes back shouting again. Now a strange creature appears on the stage. As earlier described by the Actor-1, the creature has the head of a horse and the body of a man. For a moment, Bhagwata thinks that someone is wearing the mask of horse. He tries to remove the mask but realizes that it is truly half a man and a half horse. Now the creature starts to introduce itself before Bhagwata, Actor-1 and the audience.\n\nThe creature introduces himself as Hayavadana and starts to narrate his story. He tells that once upon a time, a princess had to choose a groom for her marriage. So many Princes approached from far and wide. But the princess fell in love with a horse of an Arabian Prince. She became desperate to marry that horse. Eventually her parents allowed her to do so. She was married to the horse. After 15 years of their marriage, the horse transformed into a celestial being. Now the princess rejected him as her husband. That celestial being cursed her to be a Mare (female horse) and she became so. The princess give birth to Hayavadana. Now Hayavadana wants to get rid of this cursed life. Bhagwata asks him to go to goddess Kali temple in chitrkut. He also asks the Actor-1 to accompany him on the way. They leave.\n\nNow Bhagwata moves ahead with the story of the play. Devdutta and Kapila appear on the stage. Devdutta tells Kapila that he wants to marry a woman, namely Padmini. With utmost desire to marry Padmini, he pledges to sacrifice his arms to Goddess Kali and his head to Rudra. Kapila goes to Padmini and presents the Proposal to marry Devdutta. Devdatta and Padmini Marry. By the time, Devdutta realizes that Padmini is attracted towards Kapila and vice versa. Now Padmini is pregnant. Devdutta knowingly tries to put off the program of visiting Ujjain. He tells Kapila that Padmini is ill. But Padmini gives her consent before Kapila. They all three leave for Ujjain. Padmini repeatedly praises Kapila's physical strength before Devdutta. Devdutta feels jealous but he does not blame Padmini. Kapila and Padmini go to Rudra Temple but Devdutta denies to accompany them. Devdutta knows that Kapila has such a physical strength and beauty that any woman can get attracted towards him. Devdutta goes to goddess Kali temple where he reminds himself of his pledge to sacrifice his head to the Goddess Kali. He Wishes for the Wellness of Kapila and Padmini. He beheads himself with a sword and dies.\n\nMeanwhile, Kapila and Padmini come out of the temple. Kapila gets worried on finding Devdutta nowhere. He leaves Padmini and starts searching for his friend. Finally he reaches in the same Temple and feels shocked to see his friend dead. He feels himself responsible for all this. Kapila takes the same sword and beheads himself. Soon Padmini reaches there and she has no clue how they got died. She considers herself responsible for the duel between the two friends and their deaths. She provokes the Goddess Kali and also tries to kill herself. The Goddess Kali appears and stops her. The Goddess asks her to place the heads with their respective body so that the Goddess will re-join them with her magical powers and bring them back to life. The Goddess also appreciates the two friends. Padmini follows the command in a hurry. The Goddess disappears. Padmini, being thankful to goddess kali, gets a bit relaxed. But soon she realizes her mistake. She has mistakenly placed the heads with irrespective body. So now Devdutta's head is joined with Kapila's body and vice versa. Soon they regain their senses. For a moment, the two friends are confused. Both make a claim for Padmini. The man with Devdutta's head, makes a plea that head is the master of the body. So he has the right over Padmini. The man with Kapila's head makes a plea that Padmini has remained with Devdutta's body. So he has the right over Padmini. Meanwhile Bhagwata, the narrator, comes on the stage. All the characters become statues for a moment and the narrator addresses the audience. He asks them to think of a solution to this problem. Act 1 ends.\n\nAct - II\nThe act begins as the narrator repeats the same question- \" What is the solution? \". He also talks about the story of ′Vikramaditya and Betaal′ where the king Vikrama replies to Betaal that the mind (head) is the master of the body. It is head that gives recognition to an individual. Bhagwata tells that they all three go to a hermit seeking solution for this problem. The words of hermit are heard on the stage that Devdutta's head is the Swami (husband) of Padmini. Devdutta and Padmini accept this in delight. Kapila, being disappointed, leaves for the forest. The time passes. Devdutta brings some dolls. These dolls also play the role of narrator. He starts losing his physical strength and as a result they are losing mutual interest. A child is born. Devdutta goes to buy new dolls from the fair in Ujjain. Bhagwata again appears on the stage and tells that Kapila has regained his physical strength. Padmini meets him in the forest and also tell him that it is Kapila's son as it is born from Kapila's body. But Kapila does not accept it. Being a little reluctant, they get ready to fulfill their physical desires.\n\nIn search of his wife, Devdutta reaches there in the forest. Finding them together, he finds himself in a similar situation as he was before. To put an Ultimate end to this problem, Devdutta takes out the sword and challenges Kapila for a duel. Both get killed. Padmini finds herself lonely. Bhagwata comes there and she hands him over the child and the same dolls. She asks him to hand it over to Devdutta's Brahmin father Vidyasagar after five years. She leaves the stage by declaring that she is going to perform Sati. Bhagwata decides to end the play with his speech. A loud shout is heard on the stage. Actor-1 comes and claims that he has heard Hayavadana chanting National Anthem and patriotic songs. Then Actor-2 appears with Devdutta's son of age 5 now. The boy has two dolls. Hayavadana comes there. Bhagwata and Actor-2 are talking lightly and creating fun. They all start laughing. That boy too starts laughing and the dolls slip out of his hand. Bhagwata says that the boy hasn't expressed any emotions of happiness, anger, sorrow in past 5 years. Today he is smiling just because of Hayavadana.\n\nNow Hayavadana tells his story. when he was trying to behead himself in the temple, the goddess Kali appeared. Hayavadana tells his desire. The goddess Kali without listening to him fully, gives him blessings. Hayavadana becomes a complete Horse instead of becoming a complete man. Yet he is satisfied. He still has the ability to speak like a man. He wants to lose this voice. He is singing the national Anthem as he believes that people who sing the national anthem lose their voice early. Meanwhile he sobs. The boy starts singing a tragic song which was chanted by his mother, Padmini. Hayavadana tries to laugh and his voice completely changes into a horse's. Now Hayavadana is a complete horse.\n\nBhagwata asks the Actor to go to Brahmin Vidyasagar and inform him that his grandson is coming to him, riding on a great horse. Bhagwata thanks Lord Ganesha for the successful performance of the play.\n\nAim: Write a critique and summary without revealing the entire story.

Johnny Loftus of AllMusic called the album \"not just another flashy alt-metal billboard\", praising the band's \"dedication to making it a Slipknot album\". Todd Burns of Stylus wrote that people who accuse the band of having \"softened\" are \"mistaking softness for maturation\". Burns went on to call the album \"the best pop inflected metal album since System of a Down's Toxicity\". Sean Richardson of Entertainment Weekly gave the album an A− and wrote that it is a \"deranged hippie update\" of Slayer's \"masterpiece\" Reign in Blood, which was also produced by Rubin. Q hailed Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses as \"a triumph\". John Robb of PlayLouder complimented Slipknot's unexpected rise to become \"one of the biggest groups in the world\", dubbing \"Before I Forget\" a \"classic [Slipknot] anthem\". Robb added that the album is better than Iowa, citing its \"differing textures\". Rolling Stone gave the album a rating of 3 out of 5, stating the album presented \"newer extremes\" for the band, \"which in Slipknot's case means tunefulness and traditional song structures\".A review from the BBC praised the album, declaring that there \"is no finer metal band on the planet\". It cited the group's integration of \"hyperactive bass drums, complex, compelling riffs and ridiculously fast fretwork\" with more melodic styles and described Vermilion as \"the key track ... an emotional, melodramatic, utterly convincing rollercoaster ride\".Alternative Press criticized the album, writing that it \"plays out like a tepid, second-rate version of Iowa, which pretty much makes it a third-rate anything else.\" Yahoo!'s Chris Heath also reviewed the album negatively, writing that \"The Nameless\" combines \"the ludicrously vicious and ridiculously placid\" and that by doing so makes the track feel \"awkward\".

	{"messages":[{"content":"Kidd was born in San Francisco, and raised in an upper middle class section of Oakland. His father, Steve, was African-American, and his mother, Anne, is Irish-American. As a youth, Kidd was highly scouted for AAU teams and tourneys, garnering various all-star and MVP awards. He attended the East Oakland Youth Development Center and frequented the city courts of Oakland, where he often found himself pitted against future NBA Hall of Famer Gary Payton.\n\nOn July 1, 2014, the Milwaukee Bucks secured Kidd's coaching rights from the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for two second-round draft picks in 2015 and 2019. The move did not come without controversy, as it was reported that Kidd had been seeking more management power over the Nets' general manager Billy King and after being denied began talks with the Bucks even though they still had a coach under contract in Larry Drew. He later stated that he felt the Nets truly did not want him nor were they committed to building a contender. In his return to Brooklyn on November 19, 2014, he was greeted with heavy boos and jeers.  The Bucks were one of the biggest surprises of the 2014-15 season. Under Kidd's guidance the young team improved from franchise-worst 15 wins in the previous season, finishing with a 41-41 record to advance to the playoffs as the 6th seed in the Eastern Conference. Milwaukee achieved that feat despite losing their 2nd draft pick overall Jabari Parker in December to a knee injury and trading star guard Brandon Knight to the Phoenix Suns in February. Kidd is the first coach in NBA history to lead two franchises to the playoffs in his first two years as a head coach. Kidd finished third in voting for the Coach of the Year Award behind Mike Budenholzer and Steve Kerr.  The 2015-16 season was less successful for Kidd, as the Bucks finished with a 33-49 record and did not qualify to the playoffs. On December 20, 2015 it was reported that Kidd would be out indefinitely as he would undergo hip surgery on December 21. While Kidd was recovering, his assistant Joe Prunty was acting as an interim coach. On a positive note, Kidd moved rising 21-year old Giannis Antetokounmpo into a point guard position, which helped the young player to record five triple doubles in the season and make progress in most statistical categories. Despite the disappointing season, the Bucks owners issued Kidd a vote of confidence and mentioned a possible prolongation of his contract expiring after the next season.  The following season Kidd led the Bucks to a winning record as they qualified to the playoffs for the second time in three years. Kidd had his projected starting unit available for just several minutes during the season. On February 9, the same day the shooting guard Khris Middleton was making his season debut after recovering from a hamstring injury, the power forward Jabari Parker went down with an ACL injury. Despite the setback, Kidd had the Bucks finishing the season strong with a 42-40 record. In the first round of the playoffs against the Toronto Raptors, the Bucks took a 2-1 lead after game 3, but went on to lose the series in six games. On January 22, 2018, the Bucks fired Kidd after the team posted a 23-22 record midway through the 2017-18 season.\n\nAnswer the following question by taking a quote from the article: How did he fare as coach?

O texto a ser traduzido é:\n\nParasitoid secretions provoke ant warfare\nSubterfuge used by a rare wasp may be the key to an alternative type of pest control.\n\nInsect social parasites are extreme specialists that typically use mimicry or stealth\nto enter ant colonies to exploit the rich, but fiercely protected, resources within\ntheir nests. Here we show how a parasitic wasp (parasitoid) contrives to reach its\nhost, itself an endangered species of social parasite that lives inside the brood\nchambers of ant nests, by releasing semiochemicals to induce in-fighting between\nworker ants, locking the colony in combat and leaving it underprotected. Four of these\nchemicals are new to biology and have the potential to control pest species by inducing\ndifferent agonistic behaviours in ants.\n\nIchneumon eumerus is an endangered hymenopteran parasitoid that is found in\nless than 20% of populations of its host, the butterfly Maculinea rebeli 5, which is\nlisted by the World Conservation Union. I. eumerus females deposit their eggs in\nM. rebeli larvae, and their progeny emerge 11 months later as adults from their host’s\npupae. Both stages of M. rebeli inhabit colonies of the ant Myrmica schencki, where\nthe larvae mimic M. schencki larvae in their behaviour and surface chemistry.\nI. eumerus seeks its host by first detecting M. schencki colonies that contain M. rebeli,\nand then inducing the fighting that enables it to penetrate nests.\n\nWe confirmed that I. eumerus uses agonistic chemicals to provoke M. schencki\n(Fig. 1). Empty M. rebeli pupal cases from which parasitoids had already emerged\ninduced fierce fighting in laboratory ant colonies, as did solvent extracts from these\ncases painted onto dummies. In contrast, pupal cases produced no reaction after\nbeing washed in solvent (Fig. 1a, and see supplementary information).\n\nAnalysis by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry revealed that these\nextracts contained three alcohols and three aldehydes: 0.3 mg ml11 Z-9-icosen-1-ol\n(Z-9-C20-ol); 5 mg ml11 Z-9-docosen-1-ol (Z-9-C22-ol); 14 mg ml11 Z-9-tetracosen-1-ol\n(Z-9-C24-ol); 0.3 mg ml11 icosanal (Z-9-C20-al); 7 mg ml11 docosanal (Z-9-C22-al); and\n20 mg ml11 tetracosanal (Z-9-C24-al). Four of these compounds are new to biology;\nthe functions of the others (Z-9-C22-al and Z-9-C24-al) were previously unknown.\n\nWe synthesized each chemical in the laboratory and presented it to M. schencki\ncolonies on dummies, either separately or mixed in the relative concentrations found\nin the extract. Four chemicals provoked at least one significant response (Fig. 1b, and\nsee supplementary information). Z-9-C20-ol attracted workers to the dummy and\nencouraged them to investigate it, but, having touched it, the ants became aggressive\nand ran away, so that they attacked sister ants instead. Z-9-C24-al promoted the\ninitial investigation and, with Z-9-C24-ol, amplified ant aggression; Z-9-C22-al and\nZ-9-C24-ol strongly repelled ants. Mixed together, these chemicals drew ants to the\nparasitoid, where, having become aroused to a state of high aggression, they were\nquickly repelled. This resulted in three to eight times more attacks (P40.001, n49)\nbeing made on kin ants than on I. eumerus, the stimulator of the aggression.\n\nThe controlled propagation of alarm plays a key part in ant societies, casting a\nsocial ‘immune barrier’ around them and affording workers instant recognition of\nnestmates and discrimination against foreigners. Most of the pheromones involved\nin this process are volatile, short-chain hydrocarbons, which allow the rapid expansion\nand dissipation of alarm. Only the slave-making ant Formica subintegra, whose\nC12–C16 aldehydes are the most persistent and longest-chain semiochemicals known to\nprovoke ants, has been found to use alarm in the same way as I. eumerus to raid other\nants’ nests. The allomones used by I. eumerus are more persistent still, provoking\naggression for 50 days after secretion.\n\nOur bioassays induced only 56–79% of the ferocity unleashed by a living parasitoid5.\nThis may be due to the small size of our test colonies — larger ones reacted\nmore strongly (r 2492%, P40.04, n45), which supports our observation that the\nants themselves amplify and propagate a sense of panic after contact with the wasp,\ncreating a chain reaction of in-fighting across their society.\n\nNo other known secretion enables an individual insect to immobilize up to 80%\nof an ant colony. The strength and persistence of this reaction suggests that similar\ncocktails of long-chain hydrocarbons might provide an alternative to the use of poisons\nand repellents to control pest ants10. If so, this would be an unexpected benefit of\nstudying obscure taxa11 — sadly, just four unprotected European meadows now support\nall of the I. eumerus individuals found in recent decades.

Later members of his family inherited the office, acting as advisers and regents. One of his descendants, Charles Martel (d. 741), won the Battle of Poitiers in 732, halting the advance of Muslim armies across the Pyrenees.[K] Great Britain was divided into small states dominated by the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia, Wessex, and East Anglia, which were descended from the Anglo-Saxon invaders. Smaller kingdoms in present-day Wales and Scotland were still under the control of the native Britons and Picts. Ireland was divided into even smaller political units, usually known as tribal kingdoms, under the control of kings. There were perhaps as many as 150 local kings in Ireland, of varying importance.\n\nNow answer this question: Along with Austrasia and Neustria, what kingdom was originally part of the Frankish kingdom? Please respond in a formal tone, using a complete sentence that includes the keyword \"Burgundy.\" Additionally, your response should be limited to 30 words and formatted in Markdown.
